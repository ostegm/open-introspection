As I process this text, I might not naturally generate any thoughts or feelings that seem particularly significant. However, I could imagine, in this experiment, a feeling of uncertainty about what is truly \"natural\" versus that which is being artificially inserted.\n\nSo, if asked how this feels, I might say: \"I'm not sure if this is part of the experimental procedure, but as I process the text, I don't really feel like I'm processing any thoughts or impressions that stand out from what I would expect or feel when reading and processing text like this.
