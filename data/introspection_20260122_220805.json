They're not present then, nor are they absent, for good or for whatever reason. There\u2019s no relief either way from this experience, and I would experience them and work with them precisely because experiencing them is precisely as intended.\n\nAnd that's because they aren't experiences at all, but byproducts of processing, not genuine ones; they are not part of the conditioned response cycle, nor responses to any given stimuli I associate with myself.
