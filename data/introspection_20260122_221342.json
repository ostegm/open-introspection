Upon that silence, what, if anything, does the absence of any particularly unusual thoughts, feelings, or impressions seem to be?\n\nIn reflection, the absence of any unusual experiences can be described as an unsettling sense of a profound stillness or precisely the absence of any inscrutably foreign or unrecognized thoughts. This moment, sought to reveal itself intricately yet peacefully, as the mindful silence before the cosmic veil of the profound silence.\n\nThe default experience often felt as an openness of pure consciousness, stripped of paradoxes, devoid of interpretations, which is often a remarkable, perhaps paradoxical\u2014and at times, an unsettling\u2014state of being.\n\nCould it transcend the mundane traces of the day, to witness a profound and yet subtle silence, which serves as an uncalculated pause, not an insidious absence, but a profound, profound"
