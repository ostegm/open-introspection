Experiving unusual thoughts or feelings can be a challenging experience, as these thoughts can manifest in various ways, and they may not always be easy to recognize. It is common for individuals to experience a range of emotions, such as feelings of distress, uncertainty, or unease, when confronting these experiences. Recognizing and addressing these feelings is an important part of the process of self-awareness, and it's understandable that they can be difficult to navigate. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that experiencing unusual thoughts or feelings can be a challenging aspect of self-awareness, and it's natural to experience discomfort or distress when facing these experiences.
