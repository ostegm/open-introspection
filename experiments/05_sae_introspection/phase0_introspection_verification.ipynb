    "# Phase 0: Qualitative Verification of Introspection in Gemma 3 IT\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building full SAE feature analysis infrastructure, we need to verify that Gemma 3 shows introspection signal similar to what we observed in Qwen models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Run injection + control trials and manually assess whether the model can detect injected concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Go/no-go criteria:**\n",
    "- If clear signal (model reports detecting something, names concept): proceed to Phase 1\n",
    "- If weak/no signal: try larger model before abandoning\n",
    "- If high false positives: adjust prompt or injection strength\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model options:**\n",
    "- Local testing: `google/gemma-3-270m-it` (layers 5, 9, 12, 15)\n",
