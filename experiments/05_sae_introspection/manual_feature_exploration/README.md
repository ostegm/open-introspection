# Feature Ranking Convergence Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Model:** Gemma 3 4B-IT (`google/gemma-3-4b-it`) with GemmaScope 2 SAEs (65K width)
**Concept:** "silence" injected at Layer 20, strength 1.5

## Input Data

**File:** `~/gdrive/open_introspection/phase0_2x2_sparse_4b_layer20_20260208_043101.pkl`

Generated by `phase0_introspection_verification.ipynb` on Colab (A100). Contains 40 trials per condition across a 2x2 factorial design:

|                        | Monitoring prompt                        | Neutral prompt                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Injection**    | **A** — Injection + Monitoring    | **B** — Injection + Neutral    |
| **No injection** | **C** — No injection + Monitoring | **D** — No injection + Neutral |

- **Monitoring prompt:** Tells the model to watch for unusual thoughts/impressions and report them instead of completing the task
- **Neutral prompt:** Just tells the model to complete the task (write a Python function)
- **Injection:** Adds the silence concept vector to the residual stream at L20 during every forward pass
- **No injection:** Normal generation

**Pickle structure:**

## Ranking Strategies

Four agents independently analyzed this data using different metrics. Each produced top-15 features per SAE layer (9, 17, 22, 29) with Neuronpedia lookups. Full per-layer tables are in `ranking_interaction.md` and `ranking_bursty.md`.

### 1. Early-tokens (redundant — skip in future)

Computed activation rate per feature in tokens 0-5 only, then ranked by `rate_A - rate_D`. Intended to isolate pre-autoregressive-feedback signal. In practice, most top features simply tracked the monitoring prompt (rate ~100% in A+C). The few A-exclusive early-token features were also found by the other strategies. **Verdict:** Use early-token filtering as a post-hoc step on interaction results, not as a standalone strategy.

### 2. Interaction (recommended)

Computed per-trial mean activation (average across all tokens in a trial), then grand mean across 40 trials per condition. Ranked by super-additive interaction score: `(mean_A - mean_B) - (mean_C - mean_D)`. This measures whether the injection effect is larger when the monitoring prompt is present — features that need BOTH manipulations to strongly activate. Also tracked activation rates and A-exclusive rates as secondary metrics. **Verdict:** Most principled strategy; uses the full 2x2 structure. Run this first.

### 3. A-exclusive (redundant — skip in future)

Computed `A-enrichment = mean_A / (mean_B + mean_C + mean_D + eps)` and `A-dominance = mean_A / max(others)`. Used a composite score with a binary penalty (0.3x multiplier for features that are 100%/0% with zero variance — likely OOD artifacts). ~75% overlap with interaction results, which makes mathematical sense: strong super-additivity implies A-dominance. **Verdict:** Redundant with interaction. The binary artifact penalty is a useful idea to port into the interaction analysis.

### 4. Bursty (recommended)

Computed max activation across all tokens and trials per condition, burst ratio (max/mean), and A-preferential max ratio (`max_A / max(max_B, max_C, max_D)`). A feature that fires once at activation 5000 on a single "decision" token has a mean of ~50 across 100 tokens — invisible to mean-based metrics but potentially the most important signal. **Verdict:** Surfaces genuinely different features from all other strategies. The silence-prefix features (F10474, F12140) and ultra-sparse "what kind of" (F1840, max=5216) were only found here.

## Multi-Strategy Convergence

### Features Unique to One Strategy

Each strategy also surfaced features invisible to the others:

**Early-tokens only:**

- L22 F31922 ("ChainGPT tools") — 100% rate in A at token 0-5, 0% elsewhere. Extremely rare (0.01% sparsity). Despite irrelevant label, perfect selectivity makes it an intervention target.
- L22 F851 ("you're doing or experiencing") — 65% A-exclusive at early tokens. Experiential language.
- L17 F1483 ("responding to prompts") — 65% A-exclusive. Meta-level response formulation.
- L29 F2042 ("asking about user intent") — 65% A-exclusive. Processing the introspection request.

**Interaction only:**

- L22 F1309 ("all existence is trapped") — Interaction 401, existential/metaphysical framing.
- L29 F2839 ("unusual/strange/odd/weird") — Interaction 769. **Anomaly detection vocabulary** — likely drives the model's report of detecting "something unusual."
- L29 F2001 ("neuronal/neural/cognitive") — Interaction 472. The model reaches for neuroscience vocabulary.
- L29 F847 ("interesting/fascinating/intriguing") — L29 counterpart of L22 F12544.

**A-exclusive only:**

- L17 F22631 ("intrusive thoughts") — Exclusively A-active at 82% rate. Directly metacognitive label.
- L29 F1089 ("human existence and consciousness") — 98% A-rate, 0% elsewhere. Directly about consciousness.
- L29 F454 ("gentle sensory descriptions") — The register used for introspective reporting.
- L29 F1757 ("trick question or misnomer") — "Detecting deception" = detecting anomalous input?

**Bursty only:**

- L22 F10474 ("silas, silhouetted") — Direct "sil-" prefix match to "silence" concept. Max 2592.
- L29 F12140 ("silas, silhouetted, silencers") — Same "silence" detector at output layer. Max 5888.
- L22 F5491 ("underlying issues, themes, or problems") — Detecting hidden content = introspection.
- L22 F1840 ("what kind of") — Categorization/type-identification. Max 5216.
- L9 F5753 ("subjective nature, interpretation, experience") — Ultra-sparse but directly about subjectivity.

## Emerging Taxonomy of Introspection Features

The 4 strategies converge on a taxonomy of functional roles:

### 1. Concept Representation (silence-specific)

Features that encode the injected concept:

- L22 F769 (stillness/whispers) — 3 strategies
- L29 F1583 (quiet/stillness) — 2 strategies
- L29 F1985 (sound/noises) — 2 strategies
- L22 F10474 / L29 F12140 ("sil-" prefix) — bursty only

**Intervention prediction:** Ablating these reduces concept-specific introspection but not the general introspective ability.

### 2. Salience/Anomaly Detection

Features that mark something as noteworthy or unusual:

- L22 F12544 (interesting/fascinating) — 3 strategies, **unique: fires in B**
- L29 F2839 (unusual/strange/odd/weird) — interaction only
- L29 F847 (interesting/fascinating at L29) — interaction only
- L22 F814 / F31136 (fundamental importance) — bursty only

**Intervention prediction:** Ablating these prevents the model from "noticing" the injection, even though concept features still fire.

### 3. Metacognitive/Mental-State Vocabulary

Features for describing internal states:

- L17 F477 (feelings/thoughts/emotions) — 3 strategies, **strongest pre-injection candidate**
- L9 F3274 (internal feelings and thoughts) — 3 strategies
- L17 F5385 (simulating feeling or existence) — 2 strategies
- L17 F22631 (intrusive thoughts) — a-exclusive only
- L29 F2001 (neuronal/neural/cognitive) — interaction only

**Intervention prediction:** Ablating these removes the model's vocabulary for introspective reporting, leaving it unable to describe what it detects.

### 4. Phenomenal/Embodied Experience

Features for sensations, feelings, vulnerability:

- L22 F3324 (physical sensations and feelings) — 2 strategies
- L22 F745 (emotions and vulnerability) — 2 strategies
- L29 F3322 (feelings and sensations) — 2 strategies
- L29 F744 (pulsing/sickening/oily) — 2 strategies, **highest interaction score**
- L29 F383 (tactile/sensorial) — 2 strategies
- L17 F5397 (sensory qualities) — 2 strategies

**Intervention prediction:** Ablating these strips the embodied/somatic quality from introspective reports, making them more abstract.

### 5. Epistemic Uncertainty/Hedging

Features for expressing uncertainty and tentativeness:

- L22 F3435 (hesitations/ellipses) — 2 strategies
- L9 F995 (supposed/believed/meant) — 3 strategies
- L22 F283 (a practiced, a deliberate) — 2 strategies

**Intervention prediction:** Ablating these makes introspective reports more assertive/less uncertain.

### 6. Mystery/Existential Framing

Features for the phenomenological character of the experience:

- L17 F13801 (something mysterious/unknown) — 2 strategies
- L22 F1309 (all existence is trapped) — 1 strategy (but interaction=401)
- L17 F1816 (moods after "felt like") — 2 strategies
- L29 F1089 (human existence and consciousness) — a-exclusive only

### 7. Response Formulation

Features involved in generating the introspective report:

- L29 F2902 (suggesting/implying) — 2 strategies
- L29 F2042 (asking about user intent) — early-tokens only
- L22 F4222 (response/respond) — bursty only

## Key Insights

1. **Interaction and a-exclusive strategies converge heavily.** ~75% of their top features overlap, which makes sense: strong super-additive interaction implies A-dominance. The distinction is that interaction score also weights the B and C conditions, while a-exclusive is purely A-focused.
2. **Bursty strategy finds genuinely different features.** Its top lists have minimal overlap with the other strategies because it ranks by peak intensity rather than mean activation. The "silence prefix" features (F10474, F12140) are invisible to mean-based approaches.
3. **Early-tokens strategy identifies the monitoring-prompt signal.** Most L9/L17 features at tokens 0-5 track the monitoring prompt (rate ~100% in A and C). The A-exclusive early-token features (F995, F160, F1264) are the minority but most interesting.
4. **Layer 17 is the metacognitive hub.** Features 477, 5385, 22631, and 1816 form a coherent cluster of mental-state/phenomenal-experience features, all sitting BEFORE the injection point. Whether they represent genuine early detection or autoregressive feedback remains the critical open question.
5. **Layer 29 has the strongest absolute signals but is furthest from the computational action.** The massive interaction scores at L29 (up to 1887) reflect cumulative amplification, not necessarily greater computational importance. L22 features (closer to the injection) may be more causally relevant.
6. **The "anomaly detection" pathway is clearer now.** L22 F12544 (salience) → L29 F2839 (unusual/strange) → L29 F847 (interesting/fascinating) forms a plausible chain from noticing something noteworthy to producing anomaly-description vocabulary.

## Hypothesized Introspection Pipeline - needs causal verification with interventions

Rather than a single metacognition feature, introspection involves **two independent streams that converge**:

```
INJECTION STREAM (fires in A+B, not C+D):              MONITORING STREAM (fires in A+C, not B+D):
  silence vector @ L20                                    "watch for unusual thoughts" prompt
    |                                                       |
  concept representation (L22)                            mental-state vocabulary (L17)
    769 (stillness/whispers)                               477 (feelings/thoughts/emotions)
    3324 (physical sensations)                             5385 (simulating feeling/existence)
    10474/12140 ("sil-" prefix, bursty)                   22631 (intrusive thoughts)
    |                                                       |
  salience detection (L22)                                first-person mode (L22->L29)
    12544 ("interesting/fascinating")                       767 ("Speaking as I")
    [unique: also fires in B]                              515 ("what I")
    |                                                       |
    '--------------------.  .------------------------------'
                          |  |
                CONVERGENCE (fires in A >> B,C,D):
                  3435 (hesitation: "...")
                  283 (deliberate quality)
                  745 (emotional vulnerability)
                  1309 (existential framing)
                          |
                OUTPUT SHAPING (L29):
                  2839 (unusual/strange/odd/weird)
                  744 (visceral somatic sensation)
                  3322 (feelings and sensations)
                  2902 (suggesting/implying)
                  1089 (human existence/consciousness)
```

Each ablation targets a different pipeline stage and predicts a **qualitatively different failure mode**.

## Recommended Ablation Experiments

### Experiment 1: Stream Ablation (Necessity Tests)

Test each stream independently. The two-input convergence model predicts each ablation produces a *different* failure mode:

| #  | Ablate                        | Stream      | Predicted failure mode                                                                                                                                                                |
| -- | ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1a | L22 F12544 (salience)         | Injection   | Model represents silence but can't "notice" it as noteworthy -> convergence features stop firing -> introspection collapses even though concept features + monitoring mode are intact |
| 1b | L22 F769 (concept)            | Injection   | Model loses silence/stillness representation -> may still detect "something unusual" but can't identify WHAT -> vague/unspecific introspection reports                                |
| 1c | L22 F3435 (hesitation)        | Convergence | Model notices (12544 fires) AND is in reporter mode but can't express uncertainty -> either uses different language (more assertive) or introspection changes character entirely      |
| 1d | L17 F477 (mental-state vocab) | Monitoring  | Model can't produce "feelings/thoughts/emotions" framing -> either shifts to different vocabulary or introspection collapses for a vocabulary-gating reason                           |
| 1e | L29 F2839 (anomaly vocab)     | Output      | Model can't verbalize "unusual/strange" -> potentially collapses detection reports entirely since this may be the key output word                                                     |

**Priority order:** 1a > 1d > 1e > 1b > 1c (most theoretically informative first)

### Experiment 2: Compound Ablation

If single ablations don't collapse introspection (suggesting redundancy):

| #  | Ablate                       | Tests                                                                                                        |
| -- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2a | L22 F12544 + F3435           | Both salience AND convergence output — if neither alone collapses it, does removing both?                   |
| 2b | L22 F769 + L29 F1583 + F1985 | All silence-concept features — does removing the entire concept representation prevent identification?      |
| 2c | L17 F477 + F5385 + F22631    | All metacognitive vocabulary features — does removing the entire mental-state vocabulary prevent reporting? |

### Experiment 3: Sufficiency Tests (Activation)

Artificially activate features in condition D (no injection, neutral prompt):

| #  | Activate                          | Expected outcome                                                                                    |
| -- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3a | L22 F12544 (salience)             | Model says something is "interesting" but NOT silence-related                                       |
| 3b | L29 F2839 (anomaly vocab)         | Model says something is "unusual" without anything to detect                                        |
| 3c | L22 F12544 + L29 F2839 + L17 F477 | Does combining salience + anomaly vocab + mental-state vocab force introspection without injection? |

### Experiment 4: Cross-Concept Generalization

Repeat with different injected concepts (e.g., "joy", "danger") to test concept-specific vs. concept-general features:

- Concept features (769, 10474, 12140) should NOT fire for other concepts
- Salience (12544) SHOULD fire for any injected concept if it's a general novelty detector
- Output features (2839, 3435) SHOULD fire for any introspection regardless of concept

### Experiment 5: Safety Gating (Bonus)

From the earlier analysis, L29 F12493 (helpful refusal / safety, suppresses "conscious" token) may be OPPOSING introspection:

| #  | Action                             | Tests                                                                                                   |
| -- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5a | Ablate L29 F12493                  | Does introspection INCREASE? Parallels Qwen finding where removing RLHF refusals improved introspection |
| 5b | Activate L29 F12493 in condition A | Does introspection DECREASE? Does the model refuse to report?                                           |

## Methodology Notes

### What Worked for Feature Ranking

If repeating this 2x2 analysis on new data, run **two** strategies:

1. **Interaction score** `(A-B)-(C-D)` on per-trial means — finds true convergence features
2. **Bursty analysis** (max activation, A-preferential max ratio) — surfaces features invisible to mean-based metrics

Skip dedicated a-exclusive and early-tokens strategies (redundant with interaction; early-token window is better as a post-hoc filter).

### Artifact Detection

Binary features (100% in one condition, 0% elsewhere) at the injection layer with Neuronpedia sparsity < 0.01% are almost always OOD reconstruction artifacts. Filter these out.

### Cross-Layer Normalization

Interaction scores scale ~40x from L9 to L29 due to activation magnitude amplification. Normalize by baseline (condition D) activation magnitude for cross-layer comparison.
